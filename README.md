## 🐍 Setting Up Your Python Environment

To make sure all the projects and code run smoothly, it's a good idea to use a virtual environment with Miniconda or Anaconda. Here's how to get started on any operating system.

### 📦 Install Miniconda (Recommended)

🔗 https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

#### 🐧 Linux
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
